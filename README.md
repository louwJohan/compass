## Deployment

### How to Clone the Repository 

- Go to the repository on GitHub https://github.com/louwJohan/compass
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- To install the packages required by the application use the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
- When developing and running the application locally set DEBUG=True in the settings.py file
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project once the application is re-deployed from Heroku

### Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository
- Go to the Application Configuration page for the application on Heroku and click on the Deploy tab.
- Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub. Enter the name of the github repository (the one used for this project is (https://github.com/louwJohan/compass) and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.
- Scroll down the page and choose to either Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project Manual Deploy was selected.
- The application can be run from the Application Configuration page by clicking on the Open App button.
- The live link for this project is (https://compass-real-estate.herokuapp.com/)

### Final Deployment steps
In your package.json file, you're going to make the following changes to your scripts property
1. Add a prebuild command for Heroku that will run the start script:
"heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve"
2. Add a script command that will create and run the development version:
"dev": "react-scripts start"
3. The next thing to do is to modify the start command with:
"start": "serve -s build"
What this means, is that the app will now run in production and, then, when you are working in gitpod, you will use the following command, in place of npm start:
npm run dev
so final script should look like:
"scripts": {
"heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve",
"dev": "react-scripts start",
"start": "serve -s build",
"build": "react-scripts build",
"test": "react-scripts test",
"eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
4. Push to heroku / github
